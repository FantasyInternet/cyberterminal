This project is still in _very_ early development so the API is _very_ basic.. There is not even any form of input yet, just som basic pixel pushing and stuff..

 1. Clone, [compile and run](./COMPILE.md) this repo.
 2. Take a look at [the API](./src/script/_lib/rom_api.d.ts)
 3. Edit either `build/my_program.js` or `src/my_program.ts`(and recompile)
 4. Reload browser and enjoy!
